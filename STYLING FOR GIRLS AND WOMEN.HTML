        <li>9. STRAPLESS DRESSES </li>
        <hr>
        <p> Some occasions call for some skin show, exuding a charm of their own. Strapless dresses bare not only your shoulders and arms but your collarbone too. We definitely recommend strapless dresses for women on the more petite side. We’re referring to those whose collar bones or beauty bones call for attention. Be it operas, theatre night or formal events, you can dawn these beauties almost anywhere.

        A great style tip to remember is to never leave that collar area exposed alone. Liven it up with a stunning necklace accessory for formal appeal or head towards a choker for a more casual look and you’ll be good to go. Women with flat chests and broad collarbones should avoid this style as it highlights areas they should be disguising.</p>
